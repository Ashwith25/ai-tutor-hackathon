      "Okay, the user wants to perform array multiplication on a 100x100 matrix in Python. Let me think about how to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the core task is matrix multiplication. In Python, the standard libraries for this are NumPy and SciPy. For GPU acceleration, libraries like CuPy or PyTorch might be used. But the user didn't specify GPU, so I should check if they want GPU acceleration. Wait, the original question just says \"How can I do that in Python?\" without mentioning GPU. But looking back at the context provided, there's a lot of discussion about GPU acceleration for small matrices, like in the NVIDIA forums. However, the user's question here is about a single 100x100 matrix multiplication, not a batch of small matrices. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user's question is about array multiplication, which could be matrix multiplication. The standard way in Python is using NumPy's matmul or @ operator. For GPU acceleration, CuPy is a NumPy-like library that uses CUDA. So, the answer should present both CPU (NumPy) and GPU (CuPy) solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the user's question didn't mention GPU, so maybe they just want the standard method. However, the context from the forums suggests that the user might be interested in GPU acceleration for batch processing of small matrices, but the current question is about a single 100x100 matrix. However, the user might be following up on that context. \n",
      "\n",
      "But according to the instructions, I need to check if a common GPU-accelerated library exists for the task. Matrix multiplication is definitely supported by CuPy. So, PATH 1 applies here. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer should first present the GPU-accelerated solution using CuPy and then the standard CPU solution with NumPy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's question is about array multiplication. If they're using NumPy, the standard method would be using np.dot or @. For CuPy, it's similar. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to make sure the code examples are correct. For example, in NumPy, multiplying two 100x100 matrices would be done with np.dot(a, b) or a @ b. Similarly in CuPy, it's the same syntax. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the key points should mention that for single matrices, the overhead of transferring data to the GPU might not be worth it, but for large batches, it's beneficial. However, the user's question is about a single matrix, so maybe the performance note should mention that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's question is about a single 100x100 matrix. The context mentioned batches of 40,000 matrices, but the current question is different. So, the answer should focus on the single matrix case. However, the user might be interested in GPU acceleration even for a single matrix. \n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, the answer should present both methods. So, the structure would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Friendly opening\n",
      "- GPU solution with CuPy\n",
      "- CPU solution with NumPy\n",
      "- Key points about performance for single vs. batched matrices.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's question is about a single matrix, so the key points should note that for single matrices, CPU is better, but for batches, GPU is better. However, the user's question is about a single matrix, so maybe the performance note should mention that using GPU for a single matrix might not be efficient due to overhead, but for multiple matrices, it's better.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the code examples would still be provided as per the libraries. \n",
      "\n",

      "Okay, the user is asking how to use SymPy to solve a differential equation and display the result in a nicely formatted way. Let me break this down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to recall the standard approach for solving differential equations with SymPy. The dsolve function is the key here. It can handle both ordinary and partial differential equations. For ODEs, you can specify the equation, the function to solve for, and the independent variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the user wants the result to be nicely formatted. SymPy's printing capabilities are pretty good. The pprint function can display expressions in a more readable format. Also, using the Eq or Eqn classes might help in presenting the solution as an equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user might not be familiar with the exact syntax for dsolve. So I should provide a clear example. Let's take a simple ODE, like the exponential decay equation. That's a common example and easy to understand.\n",
      "\n",

      "Another point is the formatting. The user might want to see the solution in terms of LaTeX or a more structured equation. Explaining the use of Eq and the different printing methods would be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider if there are any common pitfalls. For example, making sure that the equation is correctly defined with the derivative, and that the function and variables are properly declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Including an example with a more complex equation might be useful, but since the user is asking for a general method, a simple example should suffice. Also, mentioning the possibility of initial conditions if they want a particular solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the original question doesn't mention initial conditions, so maybe stick to the general solution. But it's worth noting that dsolve can handle initial conditions as well.\n",

      "\n",
      "For the nicely formatted display, using pprint with the solution should show it in a more readable form. Also, maybe mention the use of the 'pretty' printer or converting to LaTeX.\n",
