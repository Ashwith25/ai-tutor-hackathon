      "Okay, the user is asking how to multiply two matrices of size 25x50 in Python. Let me think about the best way to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to check if there's an NVIDIA GPU-accelerated library that can handle matrix multiplication for this task. The standard CPU library for matrix operations in Python is NumPy. For GPU acceleration, cuPy is a drop-in replacement for NumPy that uses CUDA, so that's probably the GPU library here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user's question is straightforward matrix multiplication, which is a common operation. Both NumPy and cuPy have functions for this. So PATH 1 applies here because cuPy exists for this task.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should start by explaining both the CPU and GPU solutions. For the GPU solution, I'll use cuPy's matmul function. For the CPU, it's NumPy's dot or matmul. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the example in the context used cuBLAS and Numba, but the user's question is about a simple multiplication. Since cuPy is more straightforward here, I should recommend that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure the code examples are correct. For cuPy, the code would be something like importing cupy as cp, converting the matrices to cupy arrays, then using cp.matmul. For NumPy, it's similar but with np.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the performance note should mention that for small matrices like 25x50, the overhead of transferring data to the GPU might make CPU faster, but for larger data, GPU would be better. But since the user's matrices are small, maybe the CPU is better here. However, the user might be interested in learning how to use GPU libraries even for small matrices.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure the answer with the headings as specified, showing both solutions. Then the performance note. No disclaimer at the end. Let me put that all together.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommended GPU Solution (with cuPy)\n",
      "To perform matrix multiplication on the GPU, we can use **cuPy**, an NVIDIA-accelerated library that mirrors NumPy's API. Below is an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import cupy as cp\n",
      "\n",
      "# Define matrices (25x50)\n",
      "A = cp.random.rand(25, 50)\n",
      "B = cp.random.rand(50, 25)  # Note: Second matrix must be 50x25 for multiplication\n",
      "\n",
      "# Perform matrix multiplication on the GPU\n",
      "result_gpu = cp.matmul(A, B)\n",
      "print(\"GPU Result:\\n\", result_gpu)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Standard CPU Solution (with NumPy)\n",
      "For comparison, here's the equivalent implementation using **NumPy** on the CPU:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import numpy as np\n",
      "\n",
      "# Define matrices (25x50)\n",
      "A = np.random.rand(25, 50)\n",
      "B = np.random.rand(50, 25)  # Note: Second matrix must be 50x25 for multiplication\n",

      "result_cpu = np.matmul(A, B)\n",
      "print(\"CPU Result:\\n\", result_cpu)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Performance Note\n",
      "For small matrices (e.g., 25x50), the CPU solution is typically faster due to the overhead of transferring data to the GPU. However, for large-scale computations or repeated operations, the GPU solution (cuPy) can provide significant speedups. Always profile both approaches for your specific use case.\n",
