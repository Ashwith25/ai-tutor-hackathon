--- User Profile for 2 years ---
<think>
Okay, let's start by analyzing the user's answers. They mentioned having 2 years of experience with Python, which is a good start. They are familiar with NumPy and Pandas, so that's intermediate knowledge in data manipulation. However, they haven't worked with GPU computing or NVIDIA libraries like CuPy or RAPIDS. They also haven't used any libraries that leverage GPU computing.

So, their knowledge level is probably intermediate. They have some experience with data science tools but no experience with GPU acceleration. The next step is to check the strategy format for intermediate users. The strategy should involve code comparisons between NumPy and CuPy, focus on performance benefits, and include benchmarking examples. That makes sense because they already know the basics but need to see how GPU can enhance their current workflows. I need to make sure the report starts with the exact phrase and follows the structure given.

**Knowledge Level**: Intermediate  
**TUTORING STRATEGY: The user is at an intermediate level.**  
The tutor should provide direct code comparisons (e.g., NumPy vs. CuPy), focus on performance benefits, and show clear benchmarking examples. Since the user is familiar with NumPy and Pandas but has no experience with GPU computing, the strategy should emphasize practical transitions from CPU-based workflows to GPU-accelerated alternatives. Highlight tangible advantages (e.g., speedups for large datasets) and introduce NVIDIA libraries like CuPy as scalable upgrades to existing tools, using hands-on examples to bridge the gap between current skills and GPU capabilities.
